## Pandemic spread modeling

Basic social distancing pandemic model. 
Agents in a population are randomly paired together with a probability of transmitting a disease at each time step. 
There's a probability that pairs don't meet, which is controlled by a social distancing factor. 
Disease will last for three time steps before agents recover, with a probability of dying at each time step.
